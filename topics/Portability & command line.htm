      While CC is meant to be a fully portable application, there are a few features that don't work from a portable app.
      Especially registered file extensions and COM support must be registered on the local machine.<br />
      <b><u>CC requires the .NET framework on it's target machine!</u></b>
    </p>

    <p>
      As mentioned above, CC is meant to be portable. It doesn't store any data in the registry nor in your <code>AppData</code> folder.
      So you can take CC on your USB-Stick with you, as well as you can "uninstall" it by just deleting its directory.
      <b>Don't forget to backup your resource files before!</b>
    </p>

      CC is neither packaged in the PortableApps format, nor is it likely to become packaged.
      CC is written in C#, so it requires the .NET framework. PortableApps does not accept this.
    </p>
    <p>
      To keep portability while offering comfortable features such as registered file extensions,
      CC supports some command line switches. 
    </p>
    <br>

    <p class="big">
      Command line
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>
    <code>--install_ext</code> causes CC to install the <code>*.ccm</code> and <code>*.ccr</code> file extensions and to register itself as default handler.
    If run on a machine which has already installed these, CC will instead uninstall them.<br />
    The app is shutdown without opening the main window.    
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
    <code>--install_COM</code> causes CC to install its COM features to the local machine.
    Running it a second time uninstalls them.<br />
    The app is shutdown without opening the main window.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
    <code>--install_full</code> installs or uninstalls both the COM features and the file extensions.<br />
    The app is shutdown without opening the main window.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
    If you pass the name of a file to CC, it will try to read it as <code>*.ccr</code> or <code>*.ccm</code> file
    and parse the contained resources.<br />
    The resources loaded by default (in the <code>\Data\</code> folder) will be ignored,
    unless the <code>--data</code> switch is present.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
    If you pass the name of a directory to CC, it will try to read all included files (also those in subfolders)
    as <code>*.ccr</code> or <code>*.ccm</code> files.<br />
    The resources loaded by default (in the <code>\Data\</code> folder) will be ignored,
    unless the <code>--data</code> switch is present.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
    <code>--data</code> enables parsing of the default resources (in the <code>\Data\</code> folder),
    even if additional resources are  passed.
    </p></li>
    </ul>
