      ChameleonCoder has a rich extensibility model. This page discusses how you can get plugins and how to handle them.<br />
      If you're interested in developing your own, see the <a href="Developers.htm">Developers section</a>.
      In case you do so: <a href="mailto:maul.esel@go4more.de">contact me</a> so that I can add your plugin to the official list.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any problems with a a plugin, please try first contacting the plugin developer. On the website there's a contact address for each plugin.<br />
      When that fails you can contact me so that I can look into your problem.

      Currently there are 4 ways to extend CC's functionality:
    </p>
    <ul class="shr">
      <li>LanguageModule</li>
      <li>Services</li>
      <li>custom resource types</li>
      <li>custom RichContent members</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    These are usually located in *.dll files. You can find and download them on the <a href="">ChameleonCoder website</a>.<br />
    Installation is the most easy thing you've ever seen: Just put them into the <code>\Components\</code> subfolder of the ChameleonCoder directory and restart CC if it is running.<br />
    Uninstallation is the same: just close CC and remove the DLL from the directory.
