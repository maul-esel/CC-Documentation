      This section contains tips, information and guidelines for developers
      who either want to participate in developing CC or want to create their own plugin.<br />
      Before reading this, make sure you have read and understood the <a href="Concepts.htm">concepts</a>.
      This is required for CC developers as well as for plugin developers.

    <p>
      The easiest way to participate in CC development is to go for
      <a href="https://github.com/maul-esel/ChameleonCoder">github</a> and create a new fork.
      Before changing anything to the concepts you should contact me. It's no problem, I change them a lot, but I need to know.
      As long as CC is in alpha stage, after contacting me I could also send you my testing resources.
