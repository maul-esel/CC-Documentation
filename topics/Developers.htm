      This section contains tips, information and guidelines for developers
      who either want to participate in developing CC or want to create their own plugin.<br />
      Before reading this, make sure you have read and understood the <a href="Concepts.htm">concepts</a>.
      This is required for CC developers as well as for plugin developers.<br />
      And last but not least don't forget to read the topic on <a href="Resource syntax.htm">Resource syntax</a>.

    <p>
      The easiest way to participate in CC development is to go for
      <a href="https://github.com/maul-esel/ChameleonCoder">github</a> and create a new fork.
      Before changing anything to the concepts you should contact me. It's no problem, I change them a lot, but I need to know.
      <u>To develop CC, you should use C#.</u>

    <p class="big">
      Developing plugins
    </p>
    <p>
      You can develop plugins in <u>any .NET language</u>. Well, not any:
      <b>you currently cannot develop plugins in dynamic languages like IronPython or IronRuby.</b>
      However, if there's enough demand for it I will consider adding this at a later point.<br />
      For more information on the plugin types you can create, see <a href="PluginTypes.htm">Plugin Types</a>.
      More information on developing plugins in general can be found <a href="Plugins.htm">here</a>.
